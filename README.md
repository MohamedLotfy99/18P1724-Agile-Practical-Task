## Stakeholders: 
League players, software admins, and application users

## First 2 sprints near vision:
By the end of the first 2 sprints the product should be able to successfully show most of the analytics required

## Project description:
This project should develop a 3rd party application for the game (League of Legends), this application should provide the player with the required graphs and analytics with in-game interactions in order to improve themselves.

## Convention used:
Modified Fibbonaci is used to choose story points, in this project 3 is the smallest story point which indicates that this story is small and simple to implement, 5 and 8 indicate medium size stories while 13 is the largest story point in this project and it indicates that this story is big. 

## Product backlog items:
1- Time series analysis
2- Role win rate
3- Counter of mutual games
4- Show previous ranked seasons

These 4 user stories are at the top of product backlog and added in the first sprint because collecting statistics comes at higher value than other features in this app, most of them are simple to implement and the team understands clearly what should be done and how to do it.

5- Interactive build suggestion
6- Items statistical analysis
7- Match history tracker
8- Champions tier list

These 4 user stories are in the 2nd sprint because they are less valuable than their previous and the team still have to discuss among them how they could implement them

9- ID banning system
10- Authentication process
11- Create messaging system 
12- Dashboard
13- Patch notes
14- Adverisments
15- API knowledge acquistion

All stories in product backlog are orederd by putting the more important stories at the top, however stories like the ones from number 9 to 15 their order may be changed later as more valuable user stories may get added or the values of current ones change either increase or decrease.
