## Stakeholders: 
League players, software admins, and application users

## First 2 sprints near vision:
By the end of the first 2 sprints the product should be able to successfully show most of the analytics required

## Project description:
This project should develop a 3rd party application for the game (League of Legends), this application should provide the player with the required graphs and analytics with in-game interactions in order to improve themselves.

## Convention used:
Modified Fibbonaci is used to choose story points, in this project 3 is the smallest story point which indicates that this story is small and simple to implement, 5 and 8 indicate medium size stories while 13 is the largest story point in this project and it indicates that this story is big. 

## Product backlog items:

1- Time series analysis

2- Role win rate

3- Counter of mutual games

4- Show previous ranked seasons

These 4 user stories are at the top of product backlog and added in the first sprint because collecting statistics comes at higher value than other features in this app, most of them are simple to implement and the team understands clearly what should be done and how to do it.

5- Interactive build suggestion

6- Items statistical analysis

7- Match history tracker

8- Champions tier list

These 4 user stories are in the 2nd sprint because they are less valuable than their previous and the team still have to discuss among them how they could implement them

9- ID banning system

10- Authentication process

11- Create messaging system 

12- Dashboard

13- Patch notes

14- Adverisments

15- API knowledge acquistion

All stories in product backlog are orederd by putting the more important stories at the top, however stories like the ones from number 9 to 15 their order may be changed later as more valuable user stories may get added or the values of current ones change either increase or decrease.

## Story points per sprint estimation:
The team is estimated to complete between 15 to 20 story points per sprint, this is done by calculating the team velocity range -using the team's historical velocity data- in order to communicate our uncertainty.

## Workflow design rationale:
As for the rationale behind this diagram is that one of the agile basic practices is (Test-driven Development), Test-driven supports developers to build automated units which makes it possible to test at any stage of development and verify backward compatibility

## Sprint Document:
### Sprint 1:
In this sprint, the main objective is to implement most of the application statistics such as:

•	Role win rate

•	Counter of mutual games

•	Time series analysis

•	Show previous ranked seasons

So basically, it should provide a working 3rd party application that provide both in-game and out of game help and statistics to improve the user experience.

### Sprint 2: 
In the previous sprint, all the required stories were successfully implemented and tested featuring a working application which provides statistics and in-game help for the user.

In this sprint, the main objective is to focus more on the in-game features of the app along with more statistics such as:

•	Items statistical analysis 

•	Champions tier list 

•	Match history tracker

•	Interactive build suggestion

So basically, it should add the in-game features to the application and focus more on the GUI and UX of the application.
